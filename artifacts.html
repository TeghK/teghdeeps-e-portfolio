 <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19k-x3m2yu0vTaR9mglprDt2QaxezfhQL7ncFxgczDcM/">Excel example: link </a>
<br><br>
The link above is a spreadsheet test which showcases and displayes my ability to create a spreadsheet to organize all sorts of datas and use formulas to apply a certain output for each data. This can be a  demonstration of the catholic graduate expectation is a responsible citizen or a hoistic thinker as I am helping the community and other people by organzing various data in a spreadsheet to make it easier and more accessable.

<br><br>
The wix website is an example of website building skills and website design skills. It can demonstrate the catholic graduation expectation an creative and hoistic thinker and a life long learner as these website building and designing skills will probably be with me for the rest of my life and also it shows that I am creative since i created and designed the website in a certain way.

<br><br>
The ergoonomics is a way of learning some ways of staying safe in various office scenarios. Many people do not think thatyou can get hurt at an office. However, if you work at a desk a lot and sit uncomfertably, you can end up with back problems and other physical issues. Learning about ergonomics could demonstrate :a caring family member", in a way, or a "responsible citizen" as you are learning how to keep yourself and others safe even in a small office workspace.

 <a href=":https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iyEUxiNsAIsB3tlSGoaVijta_4DvR3McERU-DtxmLaE/edit">Ergonomics meme</a>
<br><br>
A meme is a way to keep people happy and even create and help people find happiness even when sad. It can help relieve people from stress or hard moments and give them a break by laughing. It can demonstrate "a effective communicator" and "a collabrative contributer" as I am both communicating knowledge through a meme (in this situation ergonomics) and also trying to contribute to their health and common good.

<br><br>
This is an activity where we were told to understand and diffrentiate what an internet servive provider is and what the difference is between the internet servive providers are in certain areas. Learning about ISP's can demonstrate skills and can showcase the catholic graduate expectation "a self-directed, responsible and life long learner" as I have learned about the different service providers which can help me in the long run and it is a responsibility in a way.

 <a href="https://www.powtoon.com/html5-studio/?#/edit/c1WaFosEAZB">Introduction to Powtoons</a>
<br><br>
Powtoons is an incredible way to effectively give points and talk to people, like giving presentations, without losing the audience's attention. It can help in schools and office environments as it can help convey information in attractive ways which can help people with small attention spans or even attention disorders. This is an example of an "effective communicator" again as it shows that someone/ I can use a tool or some way to effectively spread and give info to others.

<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-EfROYRX3xNWsNf-tTGsvbq2e7c_1zCcJ0gALT_8gvs/">Formal Letter- Small business</a>
<br><br>
This is an example of my letter writing skills acquired in the BTT-101 class in high school. Letters/ mail or even e-mail are all good ways to communicate and talk to others. Being able to write an email or letter properly is important to people can understand what you are trying to say. If they cannot understand what you are saying, that is un effective communication. My letter writing skills demonstrate the catholic graduate expectation "an effective communicator" once again as letter writing is a form of communication, and if you cannot write one properly, that is poor communication. Hence, that makes me an effective communicator.
